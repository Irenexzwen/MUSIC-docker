Description: A pipeline for sciMARGI raw data processing.

Overview

In this document, we will first introduce the [motivation](scimargi-introduction/motivation-of-the-technology.md) for designing sciMARGI and how would our [experimental design](scimargi-introduction/experimental-design-and-steps.md) will serve the purpose.&#x20;

An overview of the sequencing [library confirgurtion](scimargi-introduction/library-configuration.md) is discussed in detail, which will guide our demultiplexing strategy in processing pipeline. The whole processing pipeline is called sciMARGI-tools and is delivered in Docker image, within which contains all necessary tools and scripts. We will also walk you through the pipeline step by step providing crucial rational and technical considerations.&#x20;
